# 3DRaytracer
3D Raytracer in C++ from scratch.
Currently supporting indirect lighting, reflection, refraction, transparency, depth of field, own scene format with materials definition and materials inheritance, etc. 

It can also load scenes from an own defined format. There are some in the repo. You can specify primitives and materials, and there is even material inheritance. 
Sadly, to make the file parser, we used quite an ancient version of ANTLR, and it's very difficult to find the libs to compile it :(
